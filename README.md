# SBB-open-shops

# This R project aims to visualize open data from SBB to make a shiny app where all shops at all railway stations in Switzerland can be displayed with their opening hours, and exact location, visualized on a map with
the selected shops displayed with symbols. There are further selectors for the category and subcategory of shops.
